## Introduction

This script is designed to process and analyze compositions in Microsoft Word (.docx) format. It utilizes various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract and categorize cohesive devices, repetitions, substitutions, ellipses, and reiterations within the text. The script also identifies and categorizes synonyms, antonyms, hyponyms, and meronyms for repeated words. Additionally, it finds and counts collocations in the text.
